### ✨ Features
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **🎙️ Voice Control** | Natural language command processing for seamless interaction. |
| **🧠 Autonomous Code Gen** | Generates Python code with **87% accuracy** for system-level operations. |
| **🎯 Task-Focused** | Prioritizes results over explanations, keeping the workflow efficient. |
| **⚙️ System Control** | Effortlessly manage files, network settings, and system resources. |
| **⚕️ Self-Healing** | Automatically identifies and fixes failed code generation attempts. |

---

### 🚀 Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
* **Python:** Version `3.9` or higher is required.
* **Groq API Key:** You'll need a key for the AI functionality.

#### Obtaining a Groq API Key
1.  Navigate to the [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys) and create an account.
2.  In the "API Keys" section, create a new key.
3.  Copy the key and save it securely.

#### Installation
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/abdulkarim20-ui/RawWick.git](https://github.com/abdulkarim20-ui/RawWick.git)
cd RawWick

# 2. Set up a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Configure your Groq API key
echo "GROQ_API_KEY = 'your-groq-api-key-here'" > Secure/ApiKeys.py
# (Note: For Windows, the path should be `Secure\ApiKeys.py`)
````

-----

### 🤖 How It Works

RawWick is a simple but powerful loop:

1.  **Listen**: `Listen.py` captures your voice commands.
2.  **Generate**: The AI (`models/groq.py`) generates Python code based on your command.
3.  **Execute**: `executors/rawwick_executor.py` runs the generated code to complete the task.

-----

### 📖 Usage

To start RawWick, simply run `main.py` from your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

  * Speak your command.
  * RawWick generates and executes the necessary code.
  * Say "exit" to quit the program.

#### 💡 First Commands to Try

| Command | What It Does | Example Generated Script |
|---|---|---|
| "Show WiFi passwords" | Retrieves and saves network credentials. | `wifi_password_export.py` |
| "Open disk partition settings" | Opens the system's disk management tool. | `disk_management.py` |
| "Count Python files in this directory" | Analyzes the current directory structure. | `directory_analyzer.py` |
